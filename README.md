# Homework #1

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Functions -
	Functions are a set of instructions that can be followed by sending in a single request. 
	You could think of a function like the fire department. When you need a fire put out you can make a single call into the station. 
	Just by making this one call multiple jobs are sent into action. Everyone one on the team has different jobs. From driving the truck,
	to holding the hose, to search and rescue and so on. Each fire fighter is like an individual part of the function used to put out fires.
	Like functions the fire fighters are always on stand by to be used over and over again. 
	
	* Parameters -
	Sticking with the fire department theme, parameters are the things we need to make our function work. Driver, hose holder, search and resue, and fire truck are the
	desription of each person or thing that is needed in order for the fire house to run the "put out the fire" function. The descriptions are reffered to as the parameters.
	
	* Arguments -
	Arguments are the actual people and objects that fill the roles outlined by each parameter. The parameters tell us what we need for our function to succeed. 
	In order for our function to work properly we must give it the arguments that match the parameters. So our driver could be Stan, hose holder could be John, 
	search and rescue could be Jason, and the fire truck might be the American LaFrance ladder truck. By sending in the proper aguments matching the parameters we
	are allowing the function of fire fighting to run properly.
	
	* `if` statements -
	If you don't eat your meat, you can't have any pudding. You may reconize this from a classic Pink Floyd song. If statements in coding work with the same principle 
	idea behind them. First you check if something is true or not, then do something else accordingly. In this case they are checking to see if you at your meat. If so
	you are given some pudding. If you didn't eat your meat then you recieve no pudding. This is a very simple example but lays out the basic idea behind an IF statement. 


2. Install Node and NPM.  NPM comes packaged with Node. https://nodejs.org/en/download/


3. Download (clone) this project folder from GitHub.


4. Navigate into the downloaded folder using Terminal(Mac) or Command Prompt(Windows).  `ls`(Mac), `dir`(Windows) and `cd <directory_name>` are the commands you need to navigate around.


5. Once you are in the folder type the command `npm install`.  This will fetch all of the needed requirements for the project.


6. Run `npm test` to run the automated tests.  At first all of the tests will be broken.  You will fill out the functions in `exercises.js` to make the tests pass.
